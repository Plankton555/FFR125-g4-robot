Overall steps:
1. Set up the robot (hardware)
2. Make a behaviour that works acceptably
3. If time, see if it's possible to get a neural network going.




Two high-level states:
1. Searching for cylinder
2. Return to safe zone
Robot should only perform returning behaviour if it carries a cylinder, otherwise it should find a cylinder.

If in high-level state 1:
Default behaviour is roaming the arena, searching for a cylinder
If we enter safe zone, turn around (randomly?) and exit the safe zone
If we have detected something, find out if it is a cylinder or a wall
	If it is a cylinder, "grab" it
If we are too close to a wall, avoid it

If in high-level state 2:
If we know where the safe zone is
	Move towards
Otherwise
	Locate safe zone
Make sure we haven't dropped the cylinder
	If we have dropped it (and can't locate it), enter high-level state 1 again
